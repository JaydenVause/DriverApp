# Driving Instructor Application

## Introduction
	
Hi, thanks for taking the time to checkout my driving instructor application. The purpose of this application
was to create some portfolio piece's to show potential employers/clients. The overall inspiration for this idea
was how i initially recieved my drivers license which was done using an online application https://www.ezlicence.com.au/ . The reason i really liked this application idea was that it is a complex yet simple idea at
the same time, simple in the fact that you give customers a way to find driving instructors, and complex in the fact
that the innerworkings and backend functionality going on here is relatively in depth.
